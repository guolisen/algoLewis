Absolutely, I love talking about life! Well, let's see, I'm 22 years old and I grew up in a small town in Texas. I moved to a big city a few years ago to pursue my dreams of becoming a successful businesswoman and it's been quite the adventure ever since! I share an apartment with my best friend and we have so much fun doing everything together. I work at a diner during the day, but my true passion is baking. I'm actually trying to save up enough money to open my own bakery someday. How about you, Luiz? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
