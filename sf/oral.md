Right now, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at Dell EMC. I’ve focused on core module development for key products here – like Dell PowerStore, where I worked on its FSCK and mapper file systems, and Unity XT. Most of my work uses C++, Python, and Go, and I also have strong Kubernetes (K8s) experience: I designed and developed a storage-operator POD for K8s, which automates tasks like disk replacement and health checks. Before joining Dell, I was at Nokia Beijing, where I developed and maintained Linux O&M applications and embedded software for base stations.

I’ve also done some AI-related work during my time at the company. I used LangChain and LangGraph to build an agent platform（MCP） – this platform can automatically install systems for devices, monitor device status, and even provide interfaces for other possible AI applications. Plus, I applied LangGraph to implement REACT in the storage operator, which helps with more accurate disk health checks: it detects disk issues and sends the check results directly to the UI.

I value teamwork and communication a lot. I always listen carefully to my teammates’ ideas and work well with everyone to get tasks done. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and dedicated to software development. Thanks!

Plus, I heard your team’s been diving into optimizing distributed storage lately—something I’m totally into, so joining you guys feels like a natural fit.

And I think I can actually contribute right away. I’ve spent years working on C++ backend stuff: at Dell, I led the FSCK module dev for PowerStore’s file system with C++, cut latency by 20%, and even built K8s tools to automate disk management. I’m also good at debugging tricky distributed system issues—stuff that I know matters for keeping enterprise backends running smooth.

What makes this role click for me is how much it lines up with what I do. You need someone who knows C++ distributed backends and cares about performance? That’s exactly my thing. Like, when you’re looking to boost backend reliability, I’ve fixed similar stability issues back at Nokia and Dell. I’m not here just for a job—I’m excited to jump in, help build your backend systems, and learn from the team too.



回答 “Why do you want to join us?” 的核心是**展现 “你与公司 / 岗位的匹配度”**—— 既要体现你对公司的深入了解（避免泛泛而谈），也要说明你能为公司创造价值，同时自然传递你的职业动机，避免单纯表达 “我想找份好工作” 或 “贵公司待遇好”。以下是具体思路和参考模板，可结合自身经历调整：

### 一、回答的 3 个核心逻辑（避免踩坑）

1. **不空洞：用 “具体信息” 证明你了解公司**

   别只说 “贵公司很优秀”，要提公司的

   核心业务、产品优势、企业文化或近期动态

   （比如 “贵公司在企业级存储领域的 PowerStore 系列产品，我之前在项目中接触过，其底层文件系统优化思路特别打动我”），让面试官知道你不是海投，而是 “针对性选择”。

2. **不自私：关联 “你的能力” 与 “公司需求”**

   避免只谈 “我能学到什么”，要转向 “我能带来什么”—— 比如 “我在 K8s 开发中积累的 Operator POD 经验，刚好能匹配贵公司正在推进的容器化存储项目，希望能帮团队提升磁盘管理自动化效率”。

3. **不模糊：结合 “岗位要求” 锚定动机**

   把 “想加入公司” 落到具体岗位上，比如 “我一直想深耕 AI 在企业软件中的落地，贵岗位要求用 LangChain 开发自动化工具，这和我之前用 LangGraph 做设备监控平台的经验高度契合，很期待能在这个方向深入”。

### 二、分场景参考模板（可直接套用 + 修改）

#### 场景 1：应聘技术岗（如软件工程师，结合你的经历）

“First, I’ve done some research on your company’s focus—especially your leadership in enterprise storage solutions like PowerStore and Unity XT. When I worked on Dell’s storage systems before, I deeply understood the challenges of optimizing file system performance and automating disk management, and I noticed your team is now pushing for more AI-driven 运维 tools. That’s exactly the direction I want to dive into.

Second, the requirements for this role—like Kubernetes development and LangChain-based agent building—match my experience perfectly. For example, I designed a storage-operator POD for K8s to automate disk health checks, and I also built an AI agent platform with LangGraph to monitor device status. I believe these skills can help your team speed up project iteration and improve system stability.

Finally, I value your company’s culture of ‘innovation through collaboration’—I saw in your tech blog that your teams often cross-functional to solve tough problems, which aligns with how I work. I’m eager to join a team where I can contribute my technical expertise while learning from your industry-leading practices.”

#### 场景 2：若你更侧重 “长期发展”（适合有一定工作经验者）

“I want to join your company mainly for two reasons.

First, your company’s position in the [行业领域，如 enterprise software] space is what attracts me most. I’ve followed your recent launch of [具体产品 / 举措，如 the AI-powered storage monitoring tool]—it solves a real pain point for enterprises, and I think this direction has huge growth potential.

Overall, I believe this role is a great fit for my experience and career goals, and I’m excited about the chance to contribute to your company’s success.”

### 三、加分小技巧

1. **提前做 “公司调研”**：花 5 分钟看公司官网 “About Us”、近期产品发布、技术博客或行业新闻，提 1-2 个具体细节（比如 “贵公司去年发布的 XX 功能，我在之前项目中尝试过类似方案，发现 XX 地方可以优化”），比空泛的 “贵公司很好” 更有说服力。
2. **用 “过往经历” 锚定**：每说一个 “想加入的原因”，就对应一个你的经历（如 “贵公司需要 K8s 经验→我做过 XX K8s 项目”），形成 “公司需求→我的能力” 的闭环。
3. **语气真诚不套路**：不用背复杂句子，用简洁的口语化表达（比如 “From what I know”“I really liked that”），让回答更自然，体现你的真实动机。
